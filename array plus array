I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays... Actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.

P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.


code

function arrayPlusArray(arr1, arr2) {
  let sum = 0;
  for ( let i=0; i<arr1.length; i++){
    const arrValue1 = arr1[i];
  const arrValue2 = arr2[i];
  const addedValue = arrValue1+arrValue2;
    sum = sum+addedValue;
  }return sum;
}
